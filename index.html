      <hr />
      <p>
        Hi there! I am Khai, a diligent and passionate master student in
        Information Technology program at The University of Queensland. Becoming
        a Machine Learning researcher is my future career ambition. I am strong
        at thinking logically and solving problem indenpendently, that is why I
        enjoy researching solution for my own problems. Before studying the
        master program at UQ, I had 8-month experience working as a web
        developer at a start-up company in Vietnam. During my spare time, I
        listen to music, read news about machine learning techniques and play
        soccer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don't hestitate to contact me at
        <a href="mailto:tranphan.khai@gmail.com">tranphan.khai@gmail.com</a> for
        a chat or a soccer match.

      <h2>COURSE REFLECTION</h2>
      <hr />
      <h4>Personal Goals:</h4>
      <p>
        At the begining of the course, there are 3 criteria I proposed for this
        course. (1) Making a complete and interesting web-based application from
        a public dataset. (2) Making friends with people coming from different
        background and degrees such as Bachelor of IT, Master of IT, Master of
        Interaction Design, etc. (3) Achieving grade 7 for this course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the course, the first expectation and second expectation has
        been achieved successfully while I have to wait for the third objective
        until December. Regarding the first objective, our product, QLD
        Bioseeker, was complete and far from my initial expectation. We got many
        good feedbacks and comments from other students and examiners.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the second objective, my group is diverse in background, language
        and ages. Paul is the oldest people in the group and he is an designer.
        Bagus is Indonesian and is the second oldest people in the group, he
        works in the economic industry. Terrence (Terry) is a game designer
        graduate coming from Melbourne. During the group project, we worked
        together and overcome many issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, due to the properties of the group where 3 of 4 people are main
        from designers and only me is a coder. Therefore, I did not have many
        chances to learn designing skills because I just coded for the whole
        group project.
      </p>
      <h4>Thoughts about course:</h4>
      <p>
        Overal, the course is fun and interesting in which students collaborate
        and do a group project based on a practical topic but there are still
        somethings that make me not really enjoy the course 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I found the some activities in the contact hour sessions was
        not really helpful for the group project. For example, the Six Hats
        activities is quite intuitive for my group because we organized weekly
        meeting and in the meeting, we also conducted the process of debating to
        make the website become better. Moreover, the activities during the
        contact hour session in week 12 will be better if it could be chaned to
        help the group project implementation. In the future, I hope several
        last weeks of the semester could be changed to the format that students
        can come to the classroom and student can work together with the help
        from tutors. It looks like a co-working space and that's quite
        interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing I want to share is the workload of the assessment. For the
        group project, I think the time for group project development is quite
        short because the design was not finalized until the week 9, meaning
        there are only 4 weeks left for the group project. For the assessment 3,
        it is quite tough to develop a website during the SWOTVAC and exam
        period. Therefore, I hope the assessment 1 and 3 can be integrated as
        one, the developing website requirement for assessment 3 is still kept
        but it should be specified at the beginning of the course so students
        can have plenty of time to doing so.

      <h2>INNOVATION SHOWCASE AT ITEE</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The Innovation Showcase happened on November 4th, 2021 at the Building
        49 of UQ. In this event, there are a lot of projects coming from
        different students. These project can be thesis projects or coursework
        projects with varying areas: robotics, energy or user design experience.
        Each category is sponsored by a company or by ITEE.
      </p>
      <img src="./assets/showcase.jpg" />
      <p>
        In this showcase, my team project was nominated for the Best User
        Experience Design and for People’s Choice categories. Alongside with my
        project, there are 3 more team who were nominated by course coordinator.
        I was a main presenter and had chance to present the work to all visiors
        and representative of Shorthand company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although my group project was not a winning team, I am still happy and
        appreciate the chance for attending this event and demonstrating my
        group's final project.
